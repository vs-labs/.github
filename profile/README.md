# VS Labs

## Origins
This organization was made by Dominik Vrbić and Ivan Skorupan, two software engineers with a passion for understanding and developing complex backend systems for various bussiness use cases.

We started with an idea of making a distributed task scheduling system, similar to how Apache Spark and load balancers work. We understand that this problem has been solved before, but our goal
is not to make something new, but rather to improve our engineering skills and better understand the underlying mechanisms utilized in already existing task scheduling software.

Later on there might be more experimental projects available under this organization. All of the software we write is open-source.
